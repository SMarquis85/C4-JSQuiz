SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```
## Acceptance Criteria

## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. To create an online Quiz from scratch, I used Jon Ducket's JAVASCRIPT & JQuery book, Google, W3Schools, CSSPortal, Snyk and all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. Comments were added in JAVASCRIPT to show what was done and for what purpose.
